	  <p><!--
	    a lot of information quickly
	    highlight about me and the work I can do.
	    His Bio is nice, awards and experience is there straight away and below I can see all types of projects he has worked on.

	    From the first page, I can see Unity, UE4, Gamejams and course work.
	    ,  gamejams is what I would be extremely keen to see. An unfortunate reality of the games industry is that there are so few jobs and a lot
	    of applicants. So for us, seeing an junior / new start with no-experience have gamejams / other persona; projects on their portfolio is great.

	   
	    We can get a quick overview of challenges they encountered, what there role was on a project and what software they used making the project.
	    With github links only (which happens a lot) it usually will be a straight rejection, because we don't have the time or resources
	    to figure this stuff out ourselves. 

	    The biggest issue we generally see is that the portfolio doesn't showcase all the skills we expect up front.
	    Usually this is with portfolios that only show off work that was done as coursework for university.
	    As a programmer in a company you want to sell your self as a problem solver and seeing people explore and learn with different
	    projects is a big step in the right direction for conveying this. 

	    I would get a website set up that conveys projects and a little bio about each, challenges and how you tackled them, role and software used.

	    Make sure to have video clips where you can. Once you get everything up if you feel you're lacking in certain areas or could be better,
	    it might be worth looking at gamejams or doing small personal challenge projects to boost the portfolio.
	    Again with the unfortunate reality of so few jobs, the folk that will get the job will be the ones doing a lot in their personal time coding.
	    Would expect to see Unreal / unity experience in a portfolio for our company too.
