	  <h3>Psychosis Defined</h3>
	  
	  <p>Why/what/goals 

Started as a hobby project during the 2020 pandemic with the aim to take a game from nothing to release using as few libraries as possible but also with the goal of learning and being realistic in mind.  

<br><br> 

Attempted to make a 3D game before this one called Cooking Innana, where I had learnt OpenGL and some of the basics of the graphics pipeline and graphics programming. Going into 2D would hopefully allow me to focus more on the gameplay / graphics programming at a level I would be able to manage without having to rely on the internet too much which would help my understanding of the subject solidify. As well as put together all of the skills I have learnt until that point into one project.  

<br><br> 

The mantra behind the project was to keep a project that was achieveable in scale and take it all the way to some sort of release. Setting out to keep the project manageable meant researching how others have gone about keeping their projects manageable, finding a technique that would suit my project, and then implenting those methods into my routine.  

<br><br> 

Background of the project/what the project aims to achieve 

Psychosis Defined is a top-down 2D rougelite, borrowing elements from building games like Terraria and Minecraft and rougelike elements from games like Isaac and Risk Of Rain. game loop is to delve, fight new enemies, craft unique items, upgrade and customize your home base, then delve again.  

<br><br> 

the project set out to combine all of my skills into a single project to solidify my understanding of the skills and to get a better grasp on planning projects and seeing the whole development cycle. do some low level windows programming and not rely on too many libraries to get as close to the programming to learn as much as I could. not only did this help my winapi knowledge, but my general programming and using / understanding how APIs are structured and how to get things done efficiently using those APIs. was exposed to a lot of programming techniques which made a huge difference to my C++ skills. 

<br><br> 

didn't use any build tools like Cmake to also get a better understanding of the building process of applications.  

While learning Vulkan, More in-depth C++, Abstracting conceptual layers from each other and how to go about planning and implementing architecting design decisions, more WinApi, compiling and building dependencies manually, getting more familiar with the maths behind games (Linear algebra, calculus, complex number system 

 

<br><br> 

What the project achieved: 

The project is still ongoing, but so far I have implemented a windows layer, graphics layer, and gameplay layer, this allows work to be done on each layer separately without having to think about what another layer is doing (for the most part). 

<br><br> 

Achieved?: 

Graphics layer: 

Shaders 

Animation 

How they work and what they are, their role and how to leverage their power 

Understanding everything has been where more of the effort has gone to with vulkan 

Assigning memory / memory transfer /  

Images and image types,  

All the scary stuff that the API exposes you to 

Windows Layer 

Delta time,  

Keeping different system updating at different times 

Frames vs game updates 

A fairly decent understanding of windows role in making an application 

Although more could be done here to demonstrate the understanding.  

Game layer 

Most of the time with the game layer has been spent testing out other people's ideas and seeing how something might work rather than implenting anything solid. Also time spent on how to structure the code to keep everything abtracted and hidden behind interfaces. 

Entity system 

Grid system 

World blocks 

Player movement systems and considerations to make 
 

<br><br> 

all this has shown me how much more there is to know, and has left me curious about optimizing for the CPU cache along with GPGPU, data oriented programming with SIMD 

 

 and to improve my <b>C++</b>, <b>WinApi</b>, and <b>Mathematic</b> skills.
