	  <h3>Psychosis Defined</h3>

	  
	  <!--<p class="github-itch"><a href="https://icubed.itch.io/">itch.io</a></p>-->
	  
	  <p>
	    Psychosis Defined was started as a hobby project during the pandemic to get exposed to the full cycle of game development, and to learn as much as possible during the lockdowns. When planning the project the thought was to use as few libraries as possible to get a fundamental understanding of every part of the game development cycle, how modern systems work, and why current game development and programming standards came to be.
<br><br>
there were a lot of challenges involving getting Vulkan set up and displaying a simple cube with a texture, and then abstracting away Vulkans' innards while not losing any of the power that Vulkan provides doing this type of low level work while trying to consider high level concepts involving gameplay and game design was extremly challenging as the sole developer of the project but I'm really glad I undertook the porject/ but here is what I managed to acheive / but ...
<br><br>
one of the biggest challenges involving Vulkan was getting descriptor sets working to pass textures and additional data to shaders in an efficient manner while considering what was happening on the cpu and it's cache. this led to a lot of research on the topic of rendering techniques and ways to structure the data within the code.
<br><br>

after learning descriptors sets and their role, and then abstracting their creation behind a class, using them became a lot simpler and I was able to then focus on other complexities of the system effectively - the importance of naming conventions and code structure became apparent (this really highlighted how important it is to have well named variables, and a naming convention to highlight differences between classes, variables, methods, class variables there will be a catch all term for naming things) everything I have learnt up to this point was put to the test
<br><br>
code snippet? what would describe the solution to the problem? don't think code snippet would really describe the solution, because the problem was a lack of understanding.

would a gif of the resulting understanding make sense? like the one currently on the page, because I understood descriptor sets I was able to draw over 10,000 images or something?
<br><br>
Although the project is not complete and nowhere near a full fledge game, I have learnt an enormous amount  about every aspect of game development, from architecting system boundaries to compiling projects with a bash script. along with learning about entity systems, mouse picking techniques, instance drawing, to name a few.
