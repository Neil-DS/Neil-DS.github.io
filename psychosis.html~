	  <h3>Psychosis Defined</h3>
	  <p>Started as a hobby project during the 2020 pandemic to get a better understanding of the graphics pipeline, I used vulkan because it's a fairly low level API and forces you to do a lot of boiler plate setup so I could learn a lot more than just using opengl<br><br>
	    
	    while thinking of what I wanted to do for this project I decided to try and stick to using as few librariues as possible. this allowed me to learn about programming the winap, i get as close to the programming to learn as much as I could. not only did this help my winapi knowledge, but my general programming and using / understanding how APIs are structured and how to get things done efficiently using those APIs. was exposed to a lot of programming techniques which made a huge difference to my C++ skills.<br><br>
	    
	    didn't use any build tools like Cmake to also get a better understanding of the building process of applications.<br><br>
	    
	    all this has shown me how much more there is to know, and has left me curious about optimizing for the CPU cache along with GPGPU, data oriented programming with SIMD<br><br>
	    
	    and to improve my <b>C++</b>, <b>WinApi</b>, and <b>Mathematic</b> skills. The game is a top-down 2D rougelite, borrowing elements from building games like Terraria and Minecraft and rougelike elements from games like Shopkeeper and Risk Of Rain. game loop is to delve, fight new enemies, craft unique items, upgrade and customize your home base.<br><br>
