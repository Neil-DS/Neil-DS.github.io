	  <h3>Psychosis Defined</h3>

	  
	  <!--<p class="github-itch"><a href="https://icubed.itch.io/">itch.io</a></p>-->
	  
	  <p>
	   Psychosis Defined was started as a hobby project during the pandemic to get exposed to the full cycle of game development, and to learn as much as possible during the lockdowns. When planning the project the thought was to use as few libraries as possible to get a fundamental understanding of every part of the game development cycle, how modern systems work, and why current game development and programming standards came to be.
<br><br>
there were a lot of challenges involving getting Vulkan set up and displaying a simple cube with a texture, and then abstracting away Vulkans' innards while not losing any of the power that Vulkan provides, doing this type of low level work while trying to consider high level concepts involving gameplay and game design was extremly challenging as the sole developer of the project but I learnt an enormous amount by undertaking this project.  
<br><br>
one of the biggest challenges involving Vulkan was understanding descriptor sets to pass additional data to shaders in an efficient manner while considering the relationship between the different systems and hardware.

The result is having a deeper understanding of the graphics pipeline and memory management to leverage a custom engines power to achieve the vision for the game of chaos by having a large amount of game objects interacting with each other.
<br><br>
Although the project is still ongoing, I have learnt an enormous amount  about every aspect of game development, from architecting system boundaries to compiling projects with a bash scripts and why you don't want to compile projects with a bash script. 
<br><br>
I will update as more progress is made and provide links and more content becomes available.
